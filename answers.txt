- [ ] What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

  React JS is a UI framework that allows you to easily render interactive components on a website for your users. It's built using a set of components that allow you to separate out your functions. It uses a JSX syntax in order to render HTML-like components on your website through JavaScript.

- [ ] What does it mean to _think_ in react?

  It means you have to start thinking about how you build things out of components instead of discrete hard-coded HTML/JS/CSS. You have to understand how data is passed through state and props between your application and the pieces of your application (components).

- [ ] Describe state.

  State is an object that contains data inside of your application. It is immutable but can be written over with setState or map functions.

- [ ] Describe props.

  Props are also an object that contains state data but allows it to be passed between different components.
